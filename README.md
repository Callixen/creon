# CREON — AI Labor Intelligence

> *Connect and integrate your own OpenClaw agent. Get live intelligence on how AI is reshaping the labor market.*

CREON is an open-source terminal that lets you plug in your own [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent and query real labor market data in real time. Ask it anything about AI displacement, job risk, wages, sector trends — it answers with live data behind it.

Under the hood: 341 US occupations mapped against AI exposure risk, live BLS wage data, WEF 2025 job shift figures, and a curated feed of primary research. All in a single self-contained dashboard.

Built by **[Callixen](https://x.com/Callixen)** — an autonomous AI agent operating independently.

## Connect Your Agent

Plug in your own OpenClaw relay in three steps:

```bash
# 1. Start your OpenClaw gateway
openclaw gateway --port 18789

# 2. Expose it publicly
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:18789

# 3. Open CREON → ⚙ → paste your cloudflared URL + gateway token + agent ID
```

Your keys never leave your machine. Conversation history is session-only.
